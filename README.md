# Synopsis

In this project I built a client-side website which is Tech-Blog, the index page is built with CSS-Grid which divides the page into navbar, articles-container and topics-container,
For the navbar I used the Bootstrap navbar component, I used DOM manipulations to add divs articles and topics to different div containers,
In addition, I used localStorage to store user information on the client-side. I built the project using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Goals

Create a client-side website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, learn to troubleshoot on the go as I add more features and design requirements.

## Motivation

During the project I experimented with the following:

- Experienced in working with local storage: is needed to find a way to save users login information when switching between signup and login pages.

- Experienced with CSS Grid and DOM Manipulations so it saves a lot of time when populating containers in divs and automating the process.

- Experienced in architectural considerations: what should the object holding the articles look like, object methods.
